		<section class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in East Germany. I spent a year in Utah where I made my first programming experience at an early age. I later studied visual communications at Bauhaus-University Weimar and graduated with a diploma on <a href="https://leanpub.com/nothingtosell-culturalpresets" target="_blank">"Cultural Presets"</a>. What interests me is the cognitive in-between different states or definitions that we create collectively as a culture and those that we make for ourselves - <code>A subconscious of communication</code>.
			To research this and expand my understanding of this I produce art shows, media and internet artworks, performances and events. 
			Therefore I also dedicated my professional career to interfaces, the in between humen and machines, and or between machines amongst themselves.</p>
