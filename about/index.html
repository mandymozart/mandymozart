			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in East Germany. At the age of 15 I started to learn the guitar, sing in the choir and spent hours figuring out how the internet was build and how to make use of it.
				I spent a year in Utah where I made my first object oriented programming experiences and build my first applications and platforms in PHP. Event calendars, self-made databases, a CMS in PHP and MySQL, sort of a myspace clone and funky battle chat concepts. I decided to study visual communications at Bauhaus-University Weimar and graduated with a diploma on <a href="https://leanpub.com/nothingtosell-culturalpresets" target="_blank">"Cultural Presets"</a>. During that long and extraordinary time I explored what is possible outside of the digital world, abandoned coding for a while, turned to semiotics but eventually returned to my roots. I set out to challenge my ideas in the real world. What interests me is the cognitive in-between different states or definitions that we create collectively as a culture and those that we make for ourselves - <code>subconscious communication</code> or what can not be communicated by itself, <i>yet</i>.
			To research this and expand my understanding of this I produce art shows, media and internet artworks, performances and events. 
			Therefore I also dedicated my professional career to interfaces, the in between human and machines, and or between machines amongst themselves.</p>
