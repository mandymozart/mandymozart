			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in East Germany. I spent a year in Utah where I made my first programming experience at an early age. I later studied visual communications at Bauhaus-University Weimar and graduated with a diploma on <a href="https://leanpub.com/nothingtosell-culturalpresets" target="_blank">"Cultural Presets - Nothing to sell or how to produce more art in less time"</a>. In my practical research about the cognitive in-between of cultural definitions I produce art shows, media and internet artworks, performances and events. 
			My professional career I dedicated to interfaces, the in between humen and machines, and or between machines amongst themselves.</p>
