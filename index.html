				Hello, I am Tilman Porsch√ºtz and it is my responsibility as a senior UI/UX engineer and designer
				to support you and your company through the storms of the eCommerce universe and the third 
				industrial revolution. I am a designer who has for many years seen the necessity for combining 
				the visual design of digital products with the means and methods of software development. 
				You and your project therefore benefit from optimal functionality, up to date aesthetics, 
				lead-optimized flow, feel and development efficiency.</p>

			<p>Feel free to contact me for consulting and/or conception of your UI/UX projects.</p>
